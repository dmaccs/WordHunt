This is a small project of a Word game where you are given a 4 x 4 grid of letters randomized based on the scrabble distribution of letters. Your goal is to maximize your score by getting as many words as possible and the longer the word the higher the score it gives you. The first time this is ran a Trie is generated and saved into your AppData folder, subsequent times the config file will show that this exists and won't re make the trie. This project uses this trie to efficiently solve all possible words from the collins dict makeable by the 4x4 grid and give points based on the length of the words you create. In addition you can generate all possible words from a 4x4 grid of letters by simply using the solve function at the main menu.
